/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 24/03/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Regrets:
    1) I didn't get to say a proper farewell to Jia Yi, in person nor on phone, and now I don't even know if I will ever get to talk to her ever again
    
    2) I regret not hugging and kissing Jia Yi at Qatar Airport. 
    It might have gotten us into trouble, but looking back on it, it would've been so much better than just letting her go through the covid screening gate, 
    and when she turned back she couldn't see me anymore.
    
    3) I regret not being stronger mentally. I tried not to spiral, but as soon as I do, I immediately relied on Jia Yi, instead of sucking things up.
    I thought that when I went through what happened with Vee, that was the lowest possible point I could ever be at, and I couldn't take it. I bothered Jia Yi then.
    Then what happened with LY hurt more than what happened with Vee, and I couldn't take it. I slowly rebuilt and bothered Jia Yi with my baggage while rebuilding.
    During my relationship with Jia Yi, I would still get my stupid BPD spirals, and fear of abandonment triggers, and I would bother Jia Yi immediately.
    
    All these bothering made her unable to love me. She felt so emotionally drained, and because of her mental block, she eventually chose herself over me.
    
    Now after what happened, everything hurts more than a thousand times during what happened with LY or Vee, and I'm still alive. I spiral almost every day,
    breaking down and being unable to do anything, and I am somehow still able to survive. I'm not living, but I'm surviving, and the times I bothered Jia Yi,
    compared to this was nothing. If I can survive this daily pain right now, I would've been able to survive my spirals in the past without bothering Jia Yi.
    Then she wouldn't have felt emotionally drained. Then she wouldn't have to choose between me or herself. Then she wouldn't have hated me and maybe wouldn't have left

    4) I regret not knowing how to be in a relationship. Jia Yi is the first person I have ever loved, but I do not know how to be a boyfriend. I tried, but I failed.
    We argued so much, even though I didn't want to argue. I love her so much and I just want to be a loving, caring boyfriend. But somehow I failed.
    I should've asked other people for advice on how to be in a relationship, especially how to be in long distance one.
    
    I really do not regret loving her and confessing to her. But I do regret not being the best person I could've been. I hate myself and I hate that I am not able to make Jia Yi happy
    I hate that I hurt her. I hate myself so much
        
    5) I regret being so broken. I hate that I am like this. I know I am seeing you to improve upon myself and to fix the brokeness, but I wish I was able to fix it long ago
    I wish I didn't bother Jia Yi with my mental issues. I just wanted to be happy together with Jia Yi. I didn't want to bother her with my emotional baggage, 
    I just wanted to be happy with her. I just want to love and cherish and take care of her but instead I was a burden and I made her hate me and
    I hate it ended up being like this
    
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 25/03/22 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Couldn't sleep, bunch of thoughts running through my mind, decided to write down some.

Regarding the overdose:

    I really did not think through my actions when I took the video and the pills. I know I was not trying to commit suicide, and hence according to my own personal rules,
    I have not broken any promises to anyone. I signed a contract with my counsellor from last year to never hurt myself. I promised Jia Yi I would contact as many people as I could.
    I promised Jia Yi I will not commit suicide. So to my half working brain at the time of my worst spiral yet, I was not breaking any of my own rules. But that was stupid.
    
    I did not realise the full impact of my actions, and how they could've been interpreted. I was careless and even though I did not intend to, nor ended up dying, if I did,
    the consequences to the people around me would've been bad, and I did not take that into account. I was selfish, and all I could think of was a) trying to get Jia Yi to stop ghosting me and talk to me,
    and b) shut my fucking brain up and go to sleep. I wanted Jia Yi to see the video, and contact me when she did, and while I waited for her, I will be sleeping and not be in conscious pain. 
    That was what I selfishly wanted. I wanted to just do whatever I can to get to talk to Jia Yi, and go to sleep, and hopefully when I wake up, everything will be magically solved.
    But of course, that was just me running from my problems, and being selfish, and thoughtless.
    
    Worst of all, I was so selfish, that I did not realise the potential impact my actions would have on Jia Yi, the person I care about the most. I am so fucking stupid.
    I am now going through the events of that night, and going through questions, and trying to answer them, and see if I can come up with a way to atone.
    
    1) How much pain did I cause Jia Yi?
        -   I really do not know, and I really do not understand the extent to which I hurt her. But I still did hurt her
        -   I did not intent to hurt Jia Yi, be it by dying, or overdosing
        -   I did not know that my actions would have hurt her
            -   Even now, weeks after what happened, I still do not fully understand why it hurt her. It does not mean her feelings of being hurt is invalid.
                It just means that I did not think things through, and until now I still have not understood. I wish to have the opportunity to talk to her,
                to try and understand, and to try and make up for it
        -   I never meant to hurt her. If I knew beforehand that my actions would've hurt her, I would've done things differently. I might have taken more xanax,
            punched the wall, cut myself, anything to stop myself from spiralling, without letting her know, and hence hurting her
            
    2) Was I trying to commit suicide? 
        -   I don't think so. I just wanted to stop my spiral anyway possible.
        -   I realised that I took xanax, and I thought about taking alcohol too, but I remember my counsellor from last year telling me that my heart can stop if I take both
        -   I would've been fine if I died. I really just wanted my brain to shut up, and dying in my sleep would've been fine as my brain was quiet
        
    3) Why did I video?
        -   I think I selfishly wanted Jia Yi to know how hurt I was by her. I felt like my feelings of hurt were being invalidated, and I wanted her to validate it
            -   I should have calmly told her the extent of my pain, and I am at fault for not doing so.
            -   I was spiralling so badly that I couldn't think straight on how to get my feelings across, I could only think of videoing, as audio messages wouldn't
                have shown my tears
                
    4) Why did I overdose?
        -   I was not consciously trying to overdose. I just wanted my brain to shut up, and the only way I knew how was to take xanax and sleep
        -   Thus, I also did not intent to video myself taking the xanax. I only intended to video my tears
        
    5) Why did I say goodbye, include instructions on unlocking my phone, and saying my "last words"?
        -   The video ended up being 800MB, which took 10+ minutes to upload
        -   After the video, I turned off the lights and laid down, but I suddenly sat up again as I realised how much xanax I actually took.
        -   I was afraid I might die, so I started to lay out instructions if I actually did die
        -   I wasn't planning to die, so I did not plan on how to deal with my death, so I rambled, but everything can be accessed via my phone.
        -   I didn't have any idea of what to say if I did die, so all I could think off was to say sorry to my parents, and to say "I love you" to Jia Yi one last time
        -   By the time the video sent, the xanax kicked in, I was super drowsy, and I said anything I can think of at that point, and so I just collapsed
            -   But because the video sent 10 minutes after I took it, after I laid out my death contingency plans, I guess it seemed like I planned to die


Regarding the breakup:
    1) Deal with it after I deal with processing the consequences of the overdose. I cannot deal with the idea of the break up right now

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 26/03/22 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Couldn't sleep again. Was feeling anxious yesterday the entire evening, so took xanax and went to bed at 9pm. Woke up at 4am missing Jia Yi very badly,
so now I'm here typing down my thoughts again

Faith:
    1) Will I ever get to talk to Jia Yi again?
        -   We pinky promised to always talk things out stay friends no matter what happens. I believe that Jia Yi knows how important all of our promises were,
        so I want to believe that eventually, may not be super soon, that Jia Yi will keep our promise
        -   A few days after the overdose, she forwarded a message to me via my mom, calling me Ketsu, and telling me that under no circumstances does she hate me.
        She also said that she needs time away for some time, but she didn't say forever
            -   However, after 3 weeks, my mom tried to contact her again, and Jia Yi got super upset. Anastasia told me that Jia Yi wants to forget.
            -   Her cousin also said that Jia Yi wants nothing to do with me.
                -   But neither of these were direct from Jia Yi. Anastasia said "I want to set things straight", not Jia Yi
                -   Her cousin barely talked to Jia Yi, and I want to assume that Jia Yi said something along the lines of "I don't want to talk about Jovian",
                with no indication of how long, or forever.
                -   Her friends blocked me, but Jia Yi hasn't blocked me on Instagram, nor Steam, nor Discord. If she wants to forget about me permanently,
                I feel like she should make it a clean complete cut
                
        * I know there are unhelpful thinking styles, such as jumping to conclusions, and one way to combat that is to think of the most logical outcome.
        A plane can crash into me at any point and I will die, but the chances of that is slim, so I shouldn't jump to that conclusion. Likewise, I should
        consider all plausible outcomes.
        
        Given what I know about Jia Yi, how much we have confided in each other, and my judge of her personality, I don't think Jia Yi has made a conclusive decision
        on whether or not to cut me from her life completely, forever. I think that right now, she is very hurt and confused, and possibly in a spiral, and just
        wants to get through school first, before dealing with me. Only after then, will she make a final decision.
        
        She has said that she doesn't ever hate people, and that there is nothing I can ever do to make her hate me. I don't think she will hate me, and I don't think
        that she will forget me. If she hates me, she would just leave me completely immediately.
        
    2) Religion
        -   My mom has told me to try praying to God for answers. I have never been religious, but right now I am desperate enough to try anything. I don't know
        which God is the real God, but I want to believe that eventually, things will end up alright.
        -   I have made promises to become a better person to God, to improve upon myself, to not give up, and in exchange, He will make everything all right.
        I am trying my best, and at times my determination wavers, but I really cherish and love Jia Yi, and I am squeezing every last drop of strength out of myself
        to continue having faith, and waiting for Jia Yi
    
    
    
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 26/03/22 Part 2 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
I stayed awake as I couldn't fall back asleep. The xanax helped, and I was calm for the rest of the day, until evening came around. Around 5pm, I started feeling anxious.

After I got released from IMH, one of the things that kept me anchored was planning to go to Japan soon. Everytime my mind would wander and start thinking about Jia Yi,
I would focus and start planning on how I want to travel to Japan, and the things I wanted to do there, etc. It has been a few weeks since then, and I feel like my
mental strength is weaker, and that plan to go to Japan hasn't really been helping.

Today Jetstar started having a sale for flights to Australia, Phillipines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand. At first I was excited, and I spent a few hours of my day
looking up Manila, and Melbourne, and planning to go there next week or something. I looked up things to do there, flight timings and prices, accomodation prices, etc.
According to Reddit, Manila is kind of dangerous, and just a boring old city, so I ended up deciding to ask my parents if I can go to Melbourne instead. My parents
were out, so I didn't talk to them yet

But at around 5pm, I just started feeling anxious. My heart hurts a lot, and it is not the usual lovesick, heartbroken, missing Jia Yi kind of pain, but rather just
a panic attack kind of pain. My heart just kept racing and racing and I don't know why. I wasn't even focusing or consciously thinking about Jia Yi, but when I do,
the pain just gets worse, alongside the lovesick heartbroken pain as well. It hurt so much that I just stopped looking forward to my plans to go to Melbourne.

After I started getting the constant panic attack, I took some xanax, and tried to not think about anything, but it still hurt. So I tried to carry on planning my trip,
talking to my parents and stuff, but it didn't help. I just know that since my latest vacation was with her, I would most likely be constantly be reminded of that, 
and it would hurt, and I would be alone in a new country when it hurts. Australia is an english-speaking country, and it is bound to have similarities to Scotland.
I feel like if I were to go site seeing and seeing the cultural sites, it will remind me of the time in Scotland. I wanted to go shopping in Melbourne, 
but I know that I would just be reminded of how we wentshopping together in Edinburgh and Isle of Skye a mere 3 months ago, and that thought just made me cry. 
I also know that if I do end up going shopping, I would see something cute, want to buy it for Jia Yi, and be reminded that there is no point buying it, 
and that thought hurts so much too and I just keep crying. 

I really want to go overseas. I cannot stay in Singapore. Everytime I leave my house, I start crying because I think about all the places I went with her. Even my void
deck reminds me of her, as I think about how she came to stay overnight with me a few times, how we navigated to my house, etc. Taking the MRT at night reminds me of her,
going to Buona Vista/Kent Ridge reminds me of her. Going to MBS with my parents reminded me of her. Going to Sentosa with my parents reminded me of her. And I just keep
crying and crying and crying and worrying my parents. So all I can do is to stay at home, and try not to cry. So I really wanted to go overseas. But I cannot either.

I don't know what to do. Everything I do reminds me of her, even when I remove gifts and photos that remind me of her, and it just hurts. And sometimes it hurts so much
I cry randomly, even in public. And even when I cry it doesn't relieve the pain. And even when I'm focusing on something else, my anxiety flares up at night, and
my heart just beats so fast and it hurts so much and it is just additional pain. I don't even know why I'm feeling anxious, but I guess that's a symptom of having
anxiety alongside a slew of other mental issues. Everything just hurts so much

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 27/03/22 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Slept during the day. Woke up at 9pm. Found out that my mom texted Jia Yi, asking checking in on her, wanting to make sure Jia Yi is safe and alive I guess. Jia Yi
didn't reply, and my mom went to bed early because she has covid. 

I'm scared that Jia Yi will feel annoyed that my mom texted her. My mom did it out of good intentions, wanting to just check on her, but not bother her, so she messaged
Jia Yi. I woke up too late to stop her, so idk but right now I feel very anxious and I feel like throwing up and wanting to go back to sleep. Idk what to do, I don't want
Jia Yi to hate me even more, or be angry at my mom for bothering her, but I can't do anything. I hate everything that is happening. I hate feeling so shitty like this.
I want to just go to sleep for a year and wake up to everything being better

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 28/03/22 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Future:
I've been watching a bunch of random youtube videos trying to get my mind off of things, and I've been watching this one guy who plays a variety of games, and
he has been talking about his upcoming wedding, and he has one video of him and his best friends and their partners on a triple date in vacation. I see those videos
and I just feel sad. Like really sad. I want to have something like that in the future with Jia Yi. I hope that future comes. I still do.

I've also been watching this youtube channel, Kara and Nate, where they travel all over the world, and one video they were separated because of covid, so Nate had
to travel alone, and he got to experience first class flying for the first time, but he really misses Kara. 

I feel so melancholic. I want a future like that. And I cannot picture a future like that with anyone else but Jia Yi. I want to go to Japan with Jia Yi. I want to
go on more holidays with Jia Yi. I want to spend more time with her. I want to experience life with her. I think from the start, I have already decided that one day
I want to marry her. And right now with everything that has happened, these thoughts just hurt a lot. But I still want this future to happen. I still want this future
to have a possibility. I really want to fix things and make the future a reality, and idk how.

Sometimes I am telling myself that I need to recover and stay alive until the future comes, and hopefully both me and Jia Yi would've grown up to be better people,
better suited for each other. And that is the only possibly logical way I can see the future I want still come to fruition despite everything that has happened. Idk
if I am being delusional right now, but this is how badly I want a future with Jia Yi, and I just cannot deal with the thought that this future might now happen. So
I am trying my best to stay alive and happy and carry on until I get a chance, but I also think of the gap between now and the possible future, I just feel so weak 
and tired. I don't know if I can do this, recovering and meeting Jia Yi again years from now, without Jia Yi. I can survive till maybe the end of this year, but
I don't know how much longer I can draw strength from my love and wants, without talking to Jia Yi.

I miss her so much and I just want to talk to her right now. I also want to have a future with her. I really really do. And I am scared that I cannot imagine nor have
a similar future with anyone else

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 29/03/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Randomly broke down yesterday night. Was the absolute worst I have ever felt thus far. Nothing triggered me, I tried to go to sleep at 8pm, and I just woke up at 1am
crying randomly and uncontrollably. The pain hurt so much that I wanted to die, and I couldn't think of any reasons to stay alive. Isn't time supposed to heal, not
make things feel worse? Why is the pain still increasing instead of subsiding.

I texted 3 of my closest friends, desperately trying to find a reason to live so that I wouldn't do anything drastic. I talked to them abit, and they were concerned,
but talking to them just doesn't calm me down at all. I tried, and my friends and family do listen to me, but I just don't find them comforting. Usually when I spiral,
a simple text from Jia Yi would make me feel calm and comforted and safe, but from everyone else, I just feel nothing.

So instead, I asked one of my friends to play games with me, and we just went and played a shooting game until 8am, while I took some more xanax, which eventually got
me to calm down sufficiently. 2 of my friends wanted to come over tonight and bring dinner over as I couldn't leave my house, and I agreed. But when I woke up,
I feel so dejected and asocial, so I told them not to come tonight. I just don't feel strong enough to host guests and talk to my friends in person.

I am also scared that them coming over and having meals with me will trigger memories of me doing the same with Jia Yi, which will just cause me to randomly break down

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 30/03/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I feel so weak. I have set a deadline on when to just give up, and I am scared that things will not improve before the deadline. I contacted my counsellor from before,
in an attempt to reach out to even more people and save myself, but I feel so so so weak and drained. I went to bed early. Woke up after 4 hours. Took xanax. Slept again,
woke up after another 4 hours. I am not able to sleep properly, and I am mentally exhausted, and honestly I don't know if I can even make it to my deadline


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 31/03/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

My heart hurts. I can't sleep continuously, and I feel like crying even when I am fully focusing on puzzles and other mental tasks. This feels worse than a break up.
It feels like I have been scolded and punished, but also that someone incredibly important to me died, that a part of me died, and also a break up. I want to give up

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 01/04/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It's a new quarter of the year. The year is passing by and I feel like I am frozen in time. I woke up today hoping that everything was an April Fools joke, and that
everything is fine and I am happy. And honestly, if Jia Yi were to message me now and say April Fools, I am 1000000000% ready to forget all the pain that has happened,
and just continue life being happy. 

Sometimes I wonder if I actually died after overdosing, and this is just my personal hell. I really cannot imagine any thing more painful than this. I told my friend
this thought, and he made fun of me, saying "I didn't know hell was so good". But I cannot see any good in my current life at all. I really can't. This really might
be hell

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 02/04/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I've been wondering about the logic. I know the events that caused whatever happened to happen. Jia Yi was hurt by thinking I was attempting suicide, and so she
chose to not contact me anymore. She cares about me so much that it hurt her when she thought I was going to die by overdose. So this is the cause of why she's ghosting
me. But I don't know the reason.

If she cares about me, shouldn't she be happy that I didn't die? The idea that I wouldn't be in her life was so stressful and painful for her, that now she no longer
wants me to be in her life? She said she cannot take the stress anymore, that she has to choose herself over me. So why did she call the ambulance, to make sure I 
didn't die? As long as I am alive, wouldn't I be stressing her out? She cares about me so much, that she no longer cares about me? That makes no sense. She said
that it is better that we both move on, but how does she know that? I am suffering so much right now, more so than I did before and during the overdose, so
doesn't that mean that it wasn't better that we both move on and cut contact? How is this better for me? 

And for her, thinking about me hurts her, so she doesn't want to think about me. But how can she move on, if she doesn't process and think about me? I don't understand
what Jia Yi wants. If Jia Yi wants me to be safe, shouldn't she stay around to make sure I am safe? If she wants me to be happy, doesn't she know that she makes me
the happiest? If Jia Yi doesn't want to be hurt by me, shouldn't she talk to me and work things out, instead of running away on her own and being hurt? What does 
Jia Yi want? If she is angry at me, shouldn't she give me a chance to explain myself and apologize? If she hates me, shouldn't she just block my mom and cut all contact?

Is she scared that if we carried on dating, in the future, I might commit suicide, and she would be extremely hurt? If so, that would never happen, because up to and 
during the overdose, I still was not thinking of suicide. I have an entire future planned out to be with her. Less than 2 weeks before the overdose, I was so 
triggered by a suicide scene in a TV show, that I messaged Jia Yi and told her that I care about her a lot. In the past, when I was in worse states, I told Anastasia
that sometimes I wish I will cut all contact so I can kill myself without affecting Jia Yi. I care about her so much that I will never want to cause her to feel guilty
if I die, but now she is assuming I did, and thus she cut contact.

She is assuming I will attempt suicide again in the future, and thus she doesn't want to deal with that, and so she leaves. Which is just a self-fulfilling prophecy

Or does she no longer care about what happens to me, she doesn't want to have anything to do with
me, so that she wouldn't have to deal with the stress anymore? If that is the case, maybe that is good. Then my actions won't hurt her anymore


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Thoughts - 02/04/22 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Her first love, her first ex, didn't treat her very well, and he broke up with her. He did so in person, as she was about to fly off. She was not able to emotionally recover for a year.

Boris, her second ex, texted her back and forth when discussing if they should break up. He sent her a bunch of reasons and how he feels, and he responded quickly whenever Jia Yi said how she felt back. When they finally broke up, they did so over a phone call. And Jia Yi, despite being a strong person, felt like dying the few days after the break up.

Jia Yi has been through break-ups and heartbreak. She has been broken up with twice. She knows how painful it hurts. And her first two exes had the decency to at least talk to her, have a conversation with her, call her, before breaking up. And even then, it still hurt her so much. So why did she ghost me for days after Valentines/Fifteeth, text me a few words saying she wants to leave, refuse to respond to me when I'm understandbly upset, refuse to respond to me when I calmed down and wanted to talk, refused to pick up my calls when I was spiralling, and refuse to talk to me after I got sent to IMH?

I never got the chance to talk to her, I never got a chance to get closure. I didn't get a clean break-up. She didn't even have the decency to call me, or even have a conversation with me, before leaving. I am medically diagnosed with anxiety, and she ghosted me. I have abandonment issues, and my biggest fear is abandonment, and she ghosted me. I don't have the strongest mental health, and yet I wasn't suicidal when I overdosed, I just wanted to talk to her. And I never got the chance

How am I supposed to move on, if I don't get treated like a human, and get the proper closure and farewell I need to move on?
